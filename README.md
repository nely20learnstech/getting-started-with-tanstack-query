# ⚛️ React + Vite + TanStack Query Starter

A modern React project setup using **Vite** and **TanStack Query** (formerly React Query) to handle **powerful, declarative data fetching and caching** in your applications.

---

## 🚀 Why Use TanStack Query?

TanStack Query is a powerful data-fetching library that solves many common problems when working with remote data in React apps:

### ✅ Benefits

- **Auto caching & background updates**: Avoid unnecessary network requests and keep your UI always up-to-date.
- **Built-in loading and error states**: Simplify your component logic by removing manual loading/error state management.
- **Out-of-the-box pagination and infinite scroll**: Powerful hooks to support paginated or infinite data.
- **DevTools support**: Debug and inspect queries using the TanStack Query DevTools.
- **Optimistic updates**: Improve perceived performance by updating the UI before the server confirms changes.
- **Query invalidation**: Smart data synchronization after mutations (create/update/delete).
- **Works well with SSR and React Native**.

> 💡 **Ideal for apps** with API interactions, complex data flows, and performance-sensitive requirements.
